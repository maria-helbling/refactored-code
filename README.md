## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
## Work done
The SEO and accessibility changes did not affect the visual of the site but optimised the code in the following areas:
- fixed broken links
- replaced generic HTML tags with semantic ones
- reduced the use of id selectors for repetitive styling in favour of class selectors
- added alt text to images
- edited heading tags to follow logically in the document
